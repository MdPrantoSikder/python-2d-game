# python-2d-game
A classic 2D platformer built with Python and Pygame, inspired by metroidvania design principles. The game features responsive player controls, smooth movement and jumping, gravity-based physics, tile-based collision detection, basic enemy AI, collectibles, and multi-level progression.

The project is intentionally kept simple and modular, making it easy to extend with new mechanics such as abilities, weapons, maps, or bosses. It’s designed as a hands-on learning project for understanding core game development concepts like game loops, physics, animation, and state management.
